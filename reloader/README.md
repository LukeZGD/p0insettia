# sock_port + p0insettia reloader
A tool for semi-untethered jailbreak of iOS 10.3.4 iPhone 5 with socket exploit.  

## Note
- All at your own risk!  

## Supported devices
- iPhone 5 (N41/N42) - iOS 10.3.4  

## Note for this jailbreak environment (iOS 10.3 or higher)  
This jailbreak will not apply the nuke sandbox patch used by h3lix.  
In iOS 10.3 and later, apps under /Applications will also be sandboxed. so, Apps such as Cydia will be sandboxed and will not work. For this reason, this jailbreak adds a key to Cydia's entitlements to disable sandbox.  

- Key `com.apple.private.security.no-container`  

Some other jailbreak apps may require this entitlement.  

- entitlement key
```
<key>com.apple.private.security.no-container</key>
<true/>
```
